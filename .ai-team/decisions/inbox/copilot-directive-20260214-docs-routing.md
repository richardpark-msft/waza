### 2026-02-14: User directive — Route doc updates to Saul after feature merges
**By:** Shayne Boyer (via Copilot)
**What:** After any feature PR merges that changes CLI commands, graders, eval YAML format, or examples, route a doc update task to Saul. Saul owns DEMO-GUIDE.md, GRADERS.md, TUTORIAL.md, examples/ READMEs, and the main README. Standing issue #148 tracks this.
**Why:** User wants documentation kept current automatically as features ship. Saul is the designated docs team member.
