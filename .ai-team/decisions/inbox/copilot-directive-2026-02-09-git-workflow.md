### 2026-02-09: User directive — proper git workflow
**By:** Shayne Boyer (via Copilot)
**What:** All issues and features must follow proper git workflow: feature branch per issue (`squad/{issue-number}-{slug}`), commit with `feat: {summary} (#{issue-number})`, push branch, open PR with `Closes #{issue-number}`, pass `@copilot` review, address feedback, then merge. No direct commits to main.
**Why:** User request — captured for team memory
