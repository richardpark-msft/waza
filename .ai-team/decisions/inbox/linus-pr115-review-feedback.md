### PR #115 review feedback addressed
**By:** Linus (Backend Dev)
**Related:** PR #115, E7 (#62)
**What:** Rebased `feat/metadata-capability` onto latest `main` (797f72c), resolved `.golangci.yml` conflict (kept v2 format with `version: "2"` header), added doc comments on `metadataSchemaVersion` and `extensionID` constants per Rusty's review. All 4 metadata tests pass. Force-pushed to `wbreza/feat/metadata-capability`.
**Why:** PR had merge conflicts after main advanced; review requested clarifying comments on constants.
