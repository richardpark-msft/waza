### 2026-02-12: azd-publish skill location convention
**By:** Wallace Breza (via Copilot)
**What:** The azd-publish skill is a repo-level skill (lives at `.github/skills/azd-publish/`), NOT part of the project eval skills under `skills/`. Repo-level automation skills go under `.github/skills/`, project eval skills go under `skills/`.
**Why:** User request — captured for team memory
