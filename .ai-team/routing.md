# Work Routing

| Work Type | Route To | Examples |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| Architecture, scope, decisions | Rusty | Design new commands, review approaches |
| Go implementation, CLI commands | Linus | Build cmd files, internal packages |
| Tests, quality, edge cases | Basher | Write *_test.go files, verify CI |
| Documentation, README, SKILL.md | Livingston | Update docs, write SKILL.md, PR body |
| Code review | Rusty | Review PRs, check quality |
| Graders, Copilot SDK | Richard Park 👤 | #28 graders, #29 SDK, #22, #23 Cobra |
| Sensei engine, compliance, tokens | Charles Lowell 👤 | #32-38 sensei, #47-51 tokens |
| Session logging | Scribe | Automatic |

## Rules

1. Eager by default — spawn all agents who could usefully start work.
2. Scribe always runs after substantial work, always background.
3. Quick facts → coordinator answers directly.
4. Human routing → pause and present to Shayne.
