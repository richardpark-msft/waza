## Files Authorized
- GitHub issues #2, #10, #14, #16, #21 (via gh CLI)
- docs/PRD.md, README.md

## Files Produced
- .ai-team/decisions/inbox/rusty-unscoped-triage.md
- .ai-team/agents/rusty/history.md (appended)
- GitHub issue comments on #2, #10, #14, #16, #21
- Labels added: priority:p2, epic:go-cli, release:backlog on #10, #14, #16, #21

## Outcome
Triaged all 5 unscoped issues. Recommended closing #2 (superseded by #14). Descoped #14 to remove JSON-RPC overlap with #16. All remaining issues labeled P2 with appropriate epics. User subsequently directed that #16 (JSON-RPC) is independent from Web UI — standalone integration layer.
