# Session Log: 2026-02-11 — PR Reviews

**Requested by:** Shayne Boyer

## Events

1. **Rusty reviewed PR #110** (action_sequence grader): requested changes — nil session bug must return zero-score result not error; alignment nit on constant naming.

2. **Rusty reviewed PR #103** (Wallace's azd extension): approved — clean, purely additive, aligns with E7 roadmap. Registry URLs need update before production.

3. **Linus fixed PR #110 review feedback**: added graceful nil session handling (zero-score return), updated test assertions, aligned constants.
