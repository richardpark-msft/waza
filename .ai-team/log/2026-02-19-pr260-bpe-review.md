# Session: PR #260 BPE Counter Review

**Requested by:** Shayne Boyer  
**Date:** 2026-02-19

## Overview

Rusty reviewed PR #260 (Implement BPE Counter by Charles Lowell).

**Verdict:** APPROVE with non-blocking comments

**Review posted to GitHub via:** `gh pr review 260 --approve`

## Key Findings

### Non-blocking Comments

1. **Dead Code — regex field in TokenCounter**
   - `regex` field is never used; suggests removal in follow-up cleanup
   - Doesn't block merge

2. **Dead Code — NewTokenizerFromFile**
   - Unused helper function; can be removed later
   - Doesn't block merge

3. **Exported Cache Field**
   - `Cache` field on engine should be unexported (`cache`) for encapsulation
   - Minor API design preference; doesn't block merge

4. **Tokenizer Flag Consistency**
   - The `--tokenizer` flag is only on `waza tokens count`
   - Commands `check`, `compare`, and `suggest` hardcode `TokenizerDefault`
   - Follow-up decision issued: all token commands should support `--tokenizer` for consistency

## Decision Outcome

**Approved** — PR is ready to merge. The non-blocking comments are captured for follow-up work. A formal decision was recorded in `.ai-team/decisions.md` regarding tokenizer flag consistency across all token commands.
