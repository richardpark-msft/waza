## 2026-02-18: Model selection directive (updated)

**By:** Shayne Boyer (via Copilot)

**What:** All coding work must use Claude Opus 4.6 (premium). All code reviews must use GPT-5.3-Codex. This supersedes and consolidates the earlier review-only directive from 2026-02-18.

**Why:** User request — captured for team memory. User explicitly stated "make sure we are coding in opus 4.6 high and reviewing in Codex 5.3" and requested this be persisted so it doesn't need repeating.
