<!-- Append new learnings below. -->

- **2026-02-09:** Wrote `internal/graders/behavior_grader_test.go` with 30 table-driven tests for the behavior grader (#98). Tests cover: max_tool_calls (pass/fail/skip-at-zero), max_tokens (pass/fail), required_tools (pass/fail/empty), forbidden_tools (pass/fail/empty), max_duration_ms (pass/fail), combined rules (all pass, partial fail, multiple fail, independent checking), edge cases (nil session, zero values, nil tools_used, result details, duration recording). Tests follow the exact patterns from regex_grader_test.go and file_grader_test.go. File is gofmt-clean. Compilation depends on Linus's `BehaviorGrader` implementation landing.
- `graders.Context` already has `Session *models.SessionDigest` field (lines 61-63 of grader.go) — no modification needed.
- The test uses `require` from testify throughout, matching project convention. All tests use `context.Background()` and `graders.Context{}` struct literals.
- errcheck with check-blank:true is enforced by golangci-lint — always capture and assert on returned errors.
- **2026-02-12:** Wrote 9 tests (+ 3 subtests) in `cmd/waza/cmd_run_test.go` for multi-model support (#39). Tests cover: flag parsing (single, multiple, edge cases), single-model override of YAML spec, multi-model execution with per-model output files, backward compatibility (no flag preserves YAML model), model name in JSON output, identity override (--model matching spec), and comparison table stdout capture. All tests pass against Linus's existing implementation.
- Multi-model runs save output as `<base>_<model>.json` per model, NOT to the original `--output` path. Tests must check per-model file paths.
- `resetRunGlobals()` must include `modelOverrides = nil` — Cobra `StringArrayVar` persists across test cases in the same process.
- For capturing stdout from `fmt.Printf` (not Cobra output), use `os.Pipe()` redirect since `cmd.SetOut(io.Discard)` only affects Cobra's own writer.
- **2026-02-15:** Wrote 21 tests for engine.Shutdown() lifecycle (#153). Two test files: `internal/execution/engine_shutdown_test.go` (12 tests: MockEngine/CopilotEngine shutdown contract, SpyEngine test double for tracking calls) and `cmd/waza/cmd_run_shutdown_test.go` (9 tests: shutdown on success, test failure, invalid format, unknown engine, multi-model, output write, github-comment format, cache enabled, verbose). SpyEngine uses `atomic.Int32` for thread safety.
- `SpyEngine` in `internal/execution/engine_shutdown_test.go` is an exported type — if Linus adds an engine factory or injection point, tests in `cmd/waza` can use `execution.SpyEngine` directly for stronger assertions.
- `CopilotEngine.Shutdown` cleans both `e.client` and `e.workspace`. Tests can set `engine.workspace` directly (under lock) to simulate workspace cleanup without needing the full SDK.
📌 Team update (2026-02-15): All developers must use claude-opus-4.6 for code. For code review, if developer isn't using Opus, reviewer uses it. — decided by Shayne Boyer
📌 Team update (2026-02-15): Don't take assigned work. Only pick up unassigned issues. — decided by Shayne Boyer
📌 Team update (2026-02-15): Multi-model execution is sequential (not parallel). Test failures non-fatal so all models complete. — decided by Linus
📌 Team update (2026-02-15): Microsoft/skills repo moving to plugin bundle structure. CI must support both flat and nested layouts. — decided by Shayne Boyer
📌 Team update (2026-02-15): All code-writing agents must use claude-opus-4.6 model — decided by Shayne Boyer

- **2026-02-17:** Wrote 16 tests (+ 13 subtests) in `cmd/waza/cmd_new_test.go` for the `waza new` command (#170, PR #173). Tests cover: in-project mode (skills/ dir present — creates skills/{name}/SKILL.md + evals/{name}/ with eval.yaml, 3 task files, fixtures; verifies NO .github/.gitignore/README.md created), standalone mode (no skills/ — creates {name}/ with all files including .github/workflows/eval.yml, .gitignore, README.md), no-overwrite safety (pre-existing SKILL.md preserved, skip message emitted), name validation (valid names, no args → error, path traversal rejected), content validation (eval.yaml has correct skill name + 3 grader types, SKILL.md frontmatter, task file IDs), interactive/template flag acceptance, root command registration, CI workflow/gitignore/readme content, fixture content, and titleCase helper.
- cmd_new_test.go patterns: table-driven subtests for name validation and task IDs, t.TempDir() for isolation, os.Chdir() to control findProjectRoot() detection of skills/ dir, both in-project and standalone modes tested.
- Key edge cases: no-overwrite safety (writeFiles skips existing files with "skip" message), standalone vs in-project detection (skills/ dir presence), path traversal rejection (/, \\, ..), --interactive with EOF stdin doesn't crash.
- **2026-02-16:** Wrote `internal/graders/diff_grader_test.go` with 48 test cases (11 top-level + 37 subtests) for the diff grader (#99). Tests cover: exact snapshot match/mismatch, diff fragment checking (+added/-removed lines), missing fragments with partial scores, file not found, empty WorkspaceDir graceful error, multiple files with partial scoring, whitespace handling (trailing spaces, trailing newlines, double spaces), edge cases (empty files, binary content, large files, unprefixed fragments), path traversal rejection, result details and duration, combined content+fragment checks. Written ahead of Linus's implementation — tests reference `NewDiffGrader`, `DiffGraderArgs`, `ExpectedFile`, `diffGrader`, and `models.GraderKindDiff` which don't exist yet. File is gofmt-clean.
- Diff grader API assumption: `ExpectedFile` struct has `Path` (workspace-relative), `Content` (exact expected string for snapshot), and `ContainsDiff` (slice of `+line`/`-line` fragments). `+` prefix = must be present, `-` prefix = must be absent, no prefix = must be present.
- Diff grader follows same patterns as file_grader: `validatePathInWorkspace` for traversal, `measureTime` for duration, zero-score with nil error for empty WorkspaceDir, partial scoring via passedChecks/totalChecks.

📌 Team update (2026-02-17): Diff grader needs unit tests (diff_grader_test.go): snapshot match/mismatch, diff fragments, missing file, path traversal. — flagged by Rusty
📌 Team update (2026-02-17): Workspace resource setup (setupWorkspaceResources) needs security tests: normal write, absolute path rejection, traversal rejection. — flagged by Rusty
