# Task: Demonstrate regex grader
# Tests the agent's ability to produce output matching specific patterns
id: regex-demo-001
name: Regex Pattern Matching Demo
description: |
  This task demonstrates the regex grader, which validates that the agent's
  output matches (or doesn't match) specific regular expression patterns.
  
  The agent is asked to list programming languages, and we verify the output
  contains expected patterns and excludes unwanted ones.

  - regex
  - pattern-matching

inputs:
  prompt: "List 3 popular programming languages for web development"
  context:
    task_type: information_query

expected:
  # Expected patterns we'd like to see
  output_contains:
    - "Python"
    - "JavaScript"

  # Regex grader validates output patterns

    config:
      # Patterns that MUST match in the output
      must_match:
        - "(?i)(python|javascript|typescript|ruby|php|java)"
        - "(?i)(web|development|backend|frontend)"
      # Patterns that MUST NOT match
      must_not_match:
        - "(?i)error|exception|failed"
        - "(?i)COBOL|Fortran"  # Unlikely for web dev!
